    A widget adaptor is the main class of a library plugin. There is a widget
    adaptor for every widget in the library that needs to do anything special
    upon certain events in Gazpacho. See this class virtual methods for
    examples of such special events.

    The rest of widgets (e.g. regular widgets) use just an instance of this
    base class, which provides the basic functionality.

    Check gazpacho/widgets/base/base.py for examples of widget adaptors.
